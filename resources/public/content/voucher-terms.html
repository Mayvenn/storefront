(“Mayvenn”, “we” or “us”) for hair product installation services provided by Mayvenn-certified stylists  (collectively, “Vouchers”).  The transfer, use and redemption of Vouchers are also subject to the Mayvenn’s Terms of Service (“TOS”) which are subject to change, available at <a href="https://shop.mayvenn.com/policy/tos">https://shop.mayvenn.com/policy/tos</a> and incorporated into these Voucher Terms by reference. In the event of any conflict between these Voucher Terms and the TOS, these Voucher Terms will control with respect to any issue involving Vouchers.  By accepting, transferring or redeeming any Voucher, you agree to be bound by these Voucher Terms.  Vouchers are promotional in nature and can be redeemed only for the service provided by a participating Mayvenn-certified stylist of installing the particular Mayvenn hair products purchased in the order linked to your promo code.  For a list of participating Mayvenn-certified stylists, please visit <a href="https://shop.mayvenn.com">shop.mayvenn.com</a>.
