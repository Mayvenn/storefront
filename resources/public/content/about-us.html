    <h2 class="navy light center"> Our story: a letter from the CEO </h2>

    <p class="my2">My name is Diishan Imira, I am the founder and CEO of Mayvenn.
    I grew up watching hairstylists in my family run their businesses, and I noticed something…
    all of the hair products that our community was buying – we weren’t selling. </p>

    <p class="my2">That didn’t sit right with me. </p>

    <p class="my2">Mayvenn began with the idea that if people of color are spending billions of dollars on beauty products,
    we should also have ownership in the businesses that sell those products.
    Furthermore, those products should be of the highest quality and delivered with world-class customer service. </p>

    <p class="my2">We created the Mayvenn platform so that the salons and hairstylists in our community could be the
    retailers of these products, and as customers you could shop in a dignified way,
    receiving the best products and service for your hard-earned money. </p>

    <p class="my2">This company started with a box of hair in the trunk of my Toyota Corolla.
    It has now grown into a nationwide movement of over 50,000 stylists, hundreds of thousands of customers,
    and millions of dollars invested back into salons in our neighborhoods. </p>

    <p class="my2">The path of entrepreneurship is difficult, but there is no better reward – nothing more beautiful,
    than living life independently and on your own terms.
    This is what I want for my community, and Mayvenn is my way of supporting that. </p>

    <p class="my2">Happy Shopping!</p>
