    <h2 class="proxima-nova content-1 bold">Exchange Policy:</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Wear it, dye it, even cut it. If you’re not in love with your hair, we’ll exchange it within 30 days.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This means that even if your hair has been previously worn, installed, cut, colored, or styled, we will still exchange it for you!</p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="proxima-nova content-1 bold">Refund Policy:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, we will refund your payment if the item is returned in its original condition within 30 days.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>"Original condition" means that the item has not been altered, washed, or used in any way. Additionally, bundles must not be unraveled to be eligible for a full refund. Wigs, closures, and frontals must have the lace and any straps intact (the lace has not been cut or colored, and the straps have not been removed).</p>
    <br />
    <p>We recommend that you confirm that you have received the correct texture, length, and other features before unwrapping and installing your hair. This will help ensure that your purchase is eligible for a full refund if you decide to switch it up. </p>
