    <h3>How We May Collect Other Information</h3>
    <br />
    <p>We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:  </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Through your browser or device:</strong>  Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services you are using.  We use this information for analytics and for improvements to the Services, and to ensure that the Services function properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Using cookies:</strong>  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data.  If you provide us with an email address, we also will store this information in a cookie and may associate it with other information we collect using cookies.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.  We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services or send them to you via email.  We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements.</li>
        <br />
        <p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.  You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.  Additional information about your choices regarding email marketing communications is provided below.</p>
        <br />
        <li><strong>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:</strong>  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.</li>
        <br />
        <p>We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals at this time.</p>
        <br />
        <li><strong>Analytics.</strong> We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.  This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.

        <li><strong> IP Address:</strong>  Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels and other analytics, diagnosing server problems, administering the Services, and fraud prevention.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>From you:</strong>  Information such as your preferred means of communication is collected when you voluntarily provide it.</li>
        <li><strong>By aggregating information:</strong>  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>How We May Use and Disclose Other Information</h3>
    <br />
    <p>We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
